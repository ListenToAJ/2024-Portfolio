# 2024 Portfolio :construction:

This website was made to showcase my projects that I have worked on over the years.

## Description

Made entirely from scratch with HTML, CSS, and Javascript along with JQuery.  This website is designed to feel like an old windows operating system and has a number of small fun easter eggs in it.  It will always be changing and improving so please check back soon!
